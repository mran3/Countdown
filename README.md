Nice application for counting all kinds of things. Made for Cornershop.

## Ultra nice app features
- You can increment and decrement your counters.
- Very nice User Interface.
- You can view your counters even if you temporarily lose your internet connection.
- If you need some ideas for counters, we have an examples sections waiting for you.

## Technical stack
- Model View Presenter Design Pattern to avoid Massive View Controllers.
- Local Storage (UserDefaults), to access the saved counters even without an internet connection.
- REST API Requests to a local Node.js server. For this, Moya is used (https://github.com/Moya/Moya). 
It helps to stop rewriting ad-hoc network layers for each new project.
- Swift 5.
